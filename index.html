            <br>
            안녕하세요!<br> '샴기르' 서버 페트의 랭크 계산기입니다<br>
            페트의 <span style="color: red;">[ 모든 스탯이 A+이상 ]</span> 으로 성장할 확률을 계산해 줍니다<br>
            계산기는 GPT를 비롯하여 칸쵸님, 다마로님 등 많은 분의 도움과 함께 제작되었습니다<br>
            <span style="color: red;">반드시 단순 참고용이나 재미로만 봐주시기를 부탁드리겠습니다</span><br>
            계산기 관련 오류 및 문의는  <span style="color: rgb(69, 86, 241);">[서포터]유미</span>로 DM주시면 감사합니다 !<br>
            모두모두가 좋은 하루 되시길 바라요 ^p^
